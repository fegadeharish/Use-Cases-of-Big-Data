# Use-Cases-of-Big-Data
This repo consists of presentations on big data as part of our curriculum at Aegis School of Data Science. The whole idea was to explore the applications of concepts and tools that we studied.

The is the first use Case of Big Data in Oil and Gas Industry. This topic is of most interest to me and hence the reason to choose it.
It shows the small fraction of work done at Baker Hughes, a GE Company in collecting the Big data and how they have joined hands with Nvidia to implements DL tools to analyse this data and make precise decisions about the identifying oil well and drill path upto these oil wells. This presentation work is mainly focussed on upstream process in O&G industry.
